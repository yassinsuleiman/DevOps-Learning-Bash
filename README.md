# 🐚 DevOps Learning – Bash Scripting (CoderCo Academy)

This repository documents my hands-on journey through the **CoderCo DevOps Academy – Bash Module**, where I built a deep and practical foundation in Bash scripting — the backbone of modern DevOps and automation workflows.

I’ve completed:
- ✅ 35 structured lessons with one script per topic  
- ✅ 15 Bash Battle Arena challenges including 3 Boss Battles  
- ✅ Extra utility scripts to test file systems, monitor changes, and automate CLI tasks

## 📚 Module Overview

| Topic                        | Lessons |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| Variables, Parameters       | ✅       |
| Arithmetic, Expansion       | ✅       |
| Conditionals (`if`, `elif`) | ✅       |
| Loops (`for`, `while`)      | ✅       |
| Functions & Inputs          | ✅       |
| Error Handling (`set -e`)   | ✅       |
| Files & Directories         | ✅       |

- 🔁 Loops, flags, and conditionals became second nature  
- ⚠️ I practiced **error-proof scripting** using `set -eux` and exit codes  
- 📜 I learned to **read logs, process files**, and script backups, alerts, and monitors  
- 🧰 Bash became a **toolbox**, not just a language
